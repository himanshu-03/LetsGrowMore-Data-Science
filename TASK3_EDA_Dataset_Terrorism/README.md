## ðŸ“Œ Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset Terrorism

Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the security of the international community. Using the `Global Terrorism Database (GTD)`, in order to quantitatively study past terrorist attacks and their temporal and spatial evolution the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to classify the degree of damage from terrorist attacks. The various factors influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three dimensions.
